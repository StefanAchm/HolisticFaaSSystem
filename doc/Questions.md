# Some Questions

1. Do I need to update lambda functions, when redeploying one?
2. Where to store Security Credentials?
3. For AWS, you need to create a Role (assigned to the Lambda function and user)
Do you need to create a role for each lambda function?
4. Is the approach with the SDKs correct?
5. Validate inputs (Regions, runtime, etc.)?
   - Is this need, or just use Strings?
   - If needed, provide some predefined values or get via api or validate?


# Some TODOs:
- Do I need some howTo for users (e.g. create accessKeys, etc.)?
- Handle exceptions
- Handle raw types
