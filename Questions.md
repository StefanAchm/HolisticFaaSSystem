# Some Questions

1. Do I need to update lambda functions, when redeploying one?
2. Where to store Security Credentials?
3. For AWS, you need to create a Role (assigned to the Lambda function and user)
Do you need to create a role for each lambda function?
4. Is the approach with the SDKs correct?


# Some TODOs:
1. use enums and constants for some properties (Region, provider, runtime, etc.)
2. Do I need some howTo for users (e.g. create accessKeys, etc.)?
